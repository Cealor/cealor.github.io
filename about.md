I'm a UI/UX designer and web developer that designs and builds universally accessible responsive web interfaces.

I believe that the web should be open, legible, accessible, and performant. It is my role as a designer and developer to ensure that these principles are maintained in my work.

I'm constantly learning and bettering my skills; always excited to further develop my understanding of inclusive web design and development.

I am currently living and working in Brisbane, Australia as a Digital Developer for [bigfish.tv](http://bigfish.tv).

I have build web products for the like of [Great Barrier Reef Foundation](https://www.barrierreef.org/), [Queensland Ballet](https://www.queenslandballet.com.au/), [Thiess](http://www.thiess.com/), [Sedgman](http://sedgman.com/), and [arTour](http://www.artour.com.au/), along with many other brands.
