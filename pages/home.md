I am constantly learning and bettering my skills; always excited to further develop my understanding of inclusive web design and development.

I have experience with a full-stack of technologies with a primary focus on creating performant website that are simple and intuative to view and maintain.

I graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Multimedia Design in 2012. Since then, I have been living and working in Brisbane, Australia as a Digital Developer for [bigfish.tv](http://bigfish.tv).
