## Skills

I am constantly learning & bettering my skills; always excited to further develop my understanding of inclusive web design & development. I help people communicate effectively on the web with simple and intuitive websites that users love.

### Strategy

I believe the best outcomes are created with a strategy that fundamentally understands user requirements and objectives.

My understanding of the technical implementation details ensures I consider all constraints including: privacy, security, internationalisation, and search engine optimisation. 

My unique skillset provides strategies that are efficient to communicate within teams, and ultimately to implement.

I can help you ensure that your website is better suited for all audiences.

- Internationalisation
- Navigation
- Search Engine Optimisation

### Design

My love of good design is central to delivering great outcomes. 

I create and implement brands through color palettes, typography, photography, and iconography, and the creation of user interfaces which are simple and intuitive to use.

I not only ensure design is well-researched for the best user experience, and planned with interfacece and data architecture, but also executed through utilising design systems. 

I am passionate about design and its impact across every aspect of the web. 

- Typography
- Icons
- SVG
- Accessibility
- Design Systems
- Responsive Web Design

### Technical

The best design outcomes on the web are ultimately delivered through their technical implantation.

I am passionate about performance, security, privacy, and accessibility. These provide the best outcomes for users, and are foundation for everything I create on the web. 

I have experience with a full-stack of technologies with a primary focus on creating performant website that are simple & intuitive to view & maintain.
